## About
Brainfuck interpreter in C. Currently very simple and bare-bones, but options will be added later, as well as possibly a shell.

## User guide
WIP

## Building
If you want to build pbf using the source code in this repository, please see [building pbf](https://github.com/Rasmustex/pbf/blob/main/BUILD.md).

***NOTE***: Currently, pbf is only tested on GNU/Linux, and is written with GNU/Linux in mind. There is, however, a good chance that it will compile and run just fine MacOS.
